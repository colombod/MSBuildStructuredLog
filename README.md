# MSBuildStructuredLog
A logger for MSBuild that records a structured representation of executed targets, tasks, property and item values. It can greatly simplify build investigations and provides a portable log interchange format (*.binlog) and a rich interactive log viewer app.

## Install:
Install from https://msbuildlog.com.

The app updates automatically via [Squirrel](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) (after launch it checks for updates in background), next launch starts the newly downloaded latest version.

## Installing the Avalonia version on Mac:

Download the latest release for [arm64](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/releases/latest/download/StructuredLogViewer-arm64.dmg) or [x64](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/releases/latest/download/StructuredLogViewer-x64.dmg).

Alternatively, you can install from Homebrew:

```
brew install structuredlogviewer
```

## Building & Running the Avalonia version on Mac/Linux:

```
git clone https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog
cd MSBuildStructuredLog
./run.sh
```

Alternatively, a longer version:

1. `dotnet build MSBuildStructuredLog.Avalonia.sln`
2. `dotnet publish MSBuildStructuredLog.Avalonia.sln --self-contained -o <some_dir>` (I used $HOME/tools/artifacts/StructuredLogViewer.Avalonia)
3. make a script `$HOME/bin/structured-log-viewer` (or whatever's on your PATH):

```
#! /bin/sh
exec dotnet ${HOME}/tools/artifacts/StructuredLogViewer.Avalonia/publish/StructuredLogViewer.Avalonia.dll "$@"
```

## Requirements:

Windows:
 * .NET Framework 4.7.2
 * MSBuild 17.0
 * Visual Studio 2022

Mac:
 * .NET SDK

## Usage:

You can pass `/bl` switch to `msbuild.exe` or `dotnet build` to record a binary build log to `msbuild.binlog`, in the same folder as the project/solution being built:

or you can build the solution or open an existing log file through the viewer app:

## Features:

 * Preprocess project files (with all imports inlined), right-click on a project -> Preprocess
 * If a log has embedded files, you can view the list of files, full-text search in all files, and use the Space key (or double-click) on most nodes to view the source code.
 * Displays [double-writes](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/wiki/Double%20write%20detection) (when files from different sources are written to the same destination during a build, thus causing non-determinism)
 * Displays target dependencies for each target
 * Narrow down the search results using the under() or project() clauses to only display results under a certain parent or project.
 * Each node in the tree has a context menu. Ctrl+C to copy an item and the entire subtree to Clipboard as text.
 * Delete to hide nodes from the tree (to get uninteresting stuff out of the way).
 * Open and save log files (option to save log files to .xml)
 * Logs can include the source code project files and all imported files used during the build.

## Investigating problems with MSBuildStructuredLog

Open an issue if you're running into something weird and I can take a look into it. If MSBuildStructuredLog crashes during the build, it will attempt to write the exception call stack to:
